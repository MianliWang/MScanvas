The original local bootstrap commit is documented in
[`docs/development/INITIALIZATION_REPORT.md`](docs/development/INITIALIZATION_REPORT.md).
The GitHub commit SHA may differ because the source tree was transferred through the
GitHub API after the remote repository was created.

## Verified toolchain

| Component | Repository contract | First verified local runtime |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Node.js | `22.23.1` in `.node-version`; minimum `22.13.0` | `22.15.1` |
| pnpm | `11.15.1` | `11.15.1` |
| Rust | `1.97.1` with rustfmt and Clippy | `1.97.1` |
| Python | dependency-free repository checker | `3.14.3` |

CI reads the exact Node version from `.node-version`. Local bootstrap accepts newer
compatible Node 22 releases while enforcing pnpm and Rust exactly.

## Bootstrap failures repaired

- GitHub Actions could not activate pnpm because the Corepack bundled with the old
  Node pin rejected pnpm's current signing key. CI and bootstrap now install the
  exact pnpm version through npm and verify it before use.
- Rust CI reached Tauri's build script before Clippy and failed because the required
  Windows icon did not exist. A repository-owned neutral source icon plus generated
  PNG/ICO outputs now make the desktop build deterministic. The artwork is a
  bootstrap placeholder, not final product branding.
- Once dependency installation was unblocked, the frontend exposed real bootstrap
  defects in Vitest setup and an obsolete explicit esbuild minifier selection. The
  tests now import their APIs and clean up deterministically, and Vite uses its
  built-in Oxc minifier.

No Rust source lint suppression or Clippy weakening was required.

## M0 ProteoWizard bounded evidence on 2026-07-24

The Rust adapter now has structural contracts for deterministic configured/`PATH`/reviewed-root discovery, matching-tool release/build probes, canonical absolute paths, typed `msaccess` and `msconvert` argv, bounded redacted diagnostics, normalized failures, direct process capture and Windows-owned process-tree cancellation. An unstable developer-only harness exposes the spike operations without creating a stable CLI contract, rejects output inside directory acquisitions and requires a fresh empty ignored output directory.

Targeted validation after the offline help/cancellation hardening passed with:

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `cargo test --locked -p mscanvas-proteowizard --all-targets` | Passed: 33 tests; 2 controlled subprocess entry points intentionally ignored |
| `cargo clippy --locked -p mscanvas-proteowizard --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` | Passed |

That targeted table is code-contract and controlled-process evidence. A later exact-head disposable-VM run established the bounded real-backend behavior summarized below; the preserved pre-continuation repository-wide validation remains historical rather than evidence for the final tree.

Repository-wide validation passed with:

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `cargo fmt --all --check` | Passed |
| `cargo clippy --locked --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` | Passed |
| `cargo test --locked --workspace --all-targets` | Passed: 32 tests; 2 controlled subprocess entry points intentionally ignored |
| `python -B scripts/check_repo.py` | Passed |
| `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --strict-peer-dependencies` | Passed |
| `pnpm lint` | Passed |
| `pnpm typecheck` | Passed |
| `pnpm test` | Passed: 2 frontend tests |
| `pnpm build` | Passed |
| `pnpm tauri build --no-bundle` | Passed; produced an ignored Windows release executable |
| `git diff --check` | Passed |

Bounded local discovery found no runnable host-installed `msconvert.exe` or `msaccess.exe`. Residual Windows Installer metadata reports a ProteoWizard version record with `ProductState = ABSENT`; it is not an installed version. After explicit download and installation authorization, the exact official Windows x64 MSI (`3.0.26204` / `a09eea9`) was downloaded outside the repository and hashed, but Windows reported Authenticode `NotSigned` with no signer. The mandatory host-install trust gate stopped before execution, installer UI, elevation or installation, and no alternate installer or unofficial source was tried.

A narrower continuation verified the matching official Windows x86_64 portable archive through the ProteoWizard selection page, `bt83` release record and site-owned S3 resolver. The `97,078,806`-byte archive has SHA-256 `A0B92B40456E080B1CB5CBEDAE0B95664F43FE3B723972FE388A60E0341564E2`. All 265 archive members passed path/type checks before extraction, extraction stayed inside a fresh temporary root, and a private inventory covered all 20 executables and 191 DLLs. The target `msconvert.exe` and `msaccess.exe` were both unsigned.

The local Windows Sandbox/VM gate stopped without changing optional features. Exact run [`30129182032`](https://github.com/MianliWang/MScanvas/actions/runs/30129182032) later used an ephemeral GitHub-hosted `windows-2025` VM and executed commit `f0d7957fbbe129263a9a89684b6ce549b1b3a086`. The unsigned portable tools ran only as a temporary non-elevated standard user with protected inputs, scoped writable paths, exact-program outbound blocks and owned-process supervision. The fixture/archive/executable identities, complete help, 12 operation records and complete teardown were verified; the sanitized artifact ZIP independently matched SHA-256 `8A07BBDBA9C195A311A00658A9FC7F086E83B6DA3943F41B12B90BC2ED23E927`.

The source-reconciled runtime result is capability-specific. Discovery/build identity is A. Metadata, summary/counts, derived TIC/filtering, scan listing, selected spectrum, overall conversion and mzML conversion are B with named parser/scientific limits. mzXML is C because the tested multi-source fixture lost one of four spectra despite exit 0. BPC, repeated navigation, large arrays, progress, real cancellation, locale stability and vendor RAW coverage remain D. The M0 provider decision is therefore still incomplete, but it is no longer blocked by unavailable isolation or absent open-format runtime evidence. See the [M0 ProteoWizard spike report](docs/spikes/M0_PROTEOWIZARD_SPIKE.md).

## M0C Slice 1 preview integrity contracts on 2026-07-26

The ProteoWizard Rust library now owns typed parsers and an operation-specific
interpreter for the evidence-backed preview subset: metadata, run summary, spectrum
table, derived TIC and one selected spectrum. Metadata preserves section and field
order, retains unrecognized field content as opaque data and assigns no scientific
meaning beyond the measured structure. Retention-time values carry an explicit unknown
unit when the backend does not emit one; this slice does not assume or normalize them to
seconds.

TIC points retain their source spectrum indices and backend order and are labeled as
derived/recomputed summed intensity rather than a stored chromatogram. A separate
retention-time-ordered projection leaves the source ordering intact. Canonical spectrum
identity retains the zero-based index and every raw representation, reconciles exact
numeric display IDs with exact `scan=<N>` native IDs and reported scan numbers, rejects
conflicts and keeps unrecognized native-ID forms opaque.

The interpreter treats exit 0 plus no generated output as typed `NoResult` only for a
selected-spectrum request whose stdout/stderr captures are complete and empty.
Diagnostic-bearing or incomplete no-output cases remain unclassified. Required preview
outputs instead fail closed when missing, empty, malformed or unexpectedly multiple, and
backend/process failures remain separate from semantic output interpretation.
Unsupported-input-like exit 0 behavior remains conservative and unclassified unless a
stable structural marker exists; English stderr is not a protocol.

This was a contract-only slice. It did not execute ProteoWizard, add or update a
dependency, change UI or Tauri behavior, or change conversion semantics. M0C remains
incomplete: Slice 2 must add mzML conversion semantic integrity and representative
open-format navigation/scale measurements. BPC, real-backend cancellation, alternate
locale and vendor-format coverage remain separate gates.

## M0C Slice 2A mzML conversion integrity on 2026-07-26

mzML conversion integrity is now a typed library contract. The developer harness
previously printed `conversion_output.xml_validation=deferred_to_evidence_orchestrator`,
which meant the only structural check of a converted file lived in a temporary PowerShell
evidence script rather than in MSCanvas.

The ProteoWizard crate owns a bounded mzML inspector that refuses document type
declarations and undeclared entities, resolves no external reference, never base64-decodes
or decompresses a binary array, and fails closed on explicit document-byte, single-text-run,
depth, element, attribute, name, value, spectrum and chromatogram limits. Array point
counts come from the declarative `defaultArrayLength` attribute, so the decompression-bomb
class is removed by construction. Controlled-vocabulary facts are recognized by accession
and scoped to their immediate parent element, so an aggregate `fileContent` marker is never
mistaken for per-spectrum representation.

Conversions are compared against source facts captured before the backend ran and
recaptured afterwards, covering filesystem identity, byte length, content hash and typed
mzML facts. Required invariants cover spectrum and chromatogram counts, MS-level
distribution, per-record binary-array counts, roles, declared point counts and payload
presence, precursor counts, consecutive index sequences, recognized scan-number agreement,
output internal consistency and the requested zlib compression policy. Numeric-encoding markers, the
`indexedmzML` wrapper, byte length, newly emitted representation markers and retention-time
unit markers stay descriptive, because the recorded evidence already shows a faithful run
can produce them. Vocabulary-derived facts and native identity degrade to unverified rather
than failing when an indirect parameter group or an opaque identifier form makes them
unestablishable.

The harness now consumes those contracts and no longer owns entry fingerprinting, output
validation or a duplicated format-to-extension mapping. Supervised runs additionally report
the peak committed memory charged to the owned Windows Job Object as an advisory
observation for the later scale measurements.

This slice did not execute ProteoWizard, change UI or Tauri behavior, enable mzXML or BPC,
implement a cache, or add a stable CLI contract. It added one explicitly approved
production dependency, `quick-xml` `=0.41.0` with default features disabled, scoped to the
bounded mzML scanner; that crate and its only required transitive dependency were already
resolved in `Cargo.lock` through `tauri`, so the dependency graph gained no crate. No
A/B/C/D rating is upgraded. M0C Slice 2B still owes representative open-format navigation
and scale measurements.

## M0C Slice 2B representative navigation and scale evidence on 2026-07-27

One representative public acquisition was measured in isolation on an ephemeral
GitHub-hosted `windows-2025` VM: PRIDE `PXD081190`, `208,408,454` bytes, license
`Creative Commons Public Domain (CC0)`. A separate acquire-and-attest run
([`30239606441`](https://github.com/MianliWang/MScanvas/actions/runs/30239606441)) re-queried
the live PRIDE record, downloaded the file once with no redirect allowance, recorded SHA-256
`262D1178303CD934223239D5D93A3B842DCA69DA09CEF58E95A39B950D26B7E8` and discarded the payload
without executing anything. Only then was that hash pinned, and the measurement run
([`30239989762`](https://github.com/MianliWang/MScanvas/actions/runs/30239989762), commit
`96334600b45fb5910f1372934e430c91435685e8`) refused to start without it.

The file is `indexedmzML` with `36,319` MS2 spectra, no chromatograms and declared point
counts from `10` to `399`. The library scanner read all `208 MB` in `844 ms`.
Selected-spectrum retrieval cost `163`–`198` ms of backend time regardless of index
position, and twenty-four deterministic indices repeated over three passes held a backend
p50 of `164` ms, p95 between `186` and `194` ms and a maximum of `199` ms. Access did not
degrade with position or repetition and later passes were not faster. Every timing and
memory figure is a single observation on a shared two-core runner and is advisory; no
threshold was created and no cache exists in this slice.

mzML conversion of the representative file returned `ConversionIntegrityOutcome::Valid`
with thirteen of fourteen properties verified, the exception being the opaque native
identifier form the canonical identity contract deliberately leaves unverified. An
independent .NET XmlReader pass agreed on validity and on both counts. The tiny control also
returned `Valid` with vocabulary-derived properties correctly degraded to unverified,
because that fixture reaches them through a `referenceableParamGroup`. Both converted
outputs were re-inspected and then navigated successfully.

The 8 MiB preview parser cap was deliberately left unchanged and was not reached: the
complete spectrum table for `36,319` spectra was `4,013,391` bytes and parsed in `40 ms`.
No API change was warranted.

One correction came out of the evidence. Selecting a legitimately peakless spectrum on
ProteoWizard's own reference fixture was falsely rejected as malformed; a spectrum with no
peaks is now a valid result with empty arrays, while declared-count disagreements remain
count mismatches and the no-result state remains distinct. The `tic` query returned exit 0
with no generated output on the representative acquisition, which the typed contract refused
to treat as success; that is a recorded capability limit, not a defect.

Sanitized evidence was independently downloaded and manually audited: the representative
acquisition name, its prefix, drive-letter and UNC paths, runner identity, workflow
environment variables, credentials and raw scientific arrays were all absent, and teardown
attested all ten proofs including acquired fixtures and generated conversion outputs. The
temporary evidence workflow and orchestration script were removed from the tree afterwards.

ADR 0003 moves from proposed to accepted for M1–M2 preview navigation with named limits.
MS1 and chromatogram behavior, TIC and BPC from representative data, vendor RAW, mzXML,
alternate locales, real cancellation and any preview cache remain outside that acceptance.

## Windows validation completed on 2026-07-23

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` | Passed |
| `pnpm lint` | Passed |
| `pnpm typecheck` | Passed |
| `pnpm test` | Passed (2 frontend tests) |
| `pnpm build` | Passed |
| `cargo fmt --all --check` | Passed |
| `cargo clippy --locked --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` | Passed |
| `cargo test --locked --workspace --all-targets` | Passed (5 Rust tests) |
| `python -B scripts/check_repo.py` | Passed |
| `pwsh -NoProfile -File .\\scripts\\bootstrap.ps1` | Passed end to end |
| `pnpm tauri build --no-bundle` | Passed; produced a Windows release executable |

The desktop executable was built but not launched. This record therefore does not
claim a rendered Windows runtime smoke test.

## Validation completed during repository initialization

- Required-file and source-of-truth contract checks.
- JSON and TOML parsing.
- GitHub workflow and issue-template YAML parsing.
- Repo-local skill frontmatter checks.
- Relative Markdown-link checks.
- Git whitespace and object-integrity checks.
- ZIP extraction and Git bundle clone verification.

## Intentionally pending

- Launch and interact with `pnpm tauri dev` on Windows; a build alone is not a
  rendered runtime check.
- Complete the remaining ProteoWizard provider gates: MS1 and chromatogram behavior, TIC
  and BPC from representative data, real cancellation, alternate-locale parsing and
  separately authorized vendor coverage. The typed preview-result/canonical-identity
  boundary, the mzML conversion-integrity contract, the bounded open-format disposable-VM
  matrix and the representative navigation and scale measurements are complete.
- Enable branch protection after the first green remote CI run.

## First verified-bootstrap checklist

- [x] Create `MianliWang/MScanvas` on GitHub.
- [x] Synchronize the initialized source tree to `main`.
- [x] Install pnpm and the Rust toolchain declared by this repository.
- [x] Run `pnpm install` and commit `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
- [x] Run `cargo generate-lockfile` and commit `Cargo.lock`.
- [x] Run all frontend and Rust checks.
- [ ] Run `pnpm tauri dev` on Windows.
- [x] Confirm Tauri capability configuration remains minimal.
- [x] Complete the M0 ProteoWizard provider decision for preview navigation; ADR 0003 is
  accepted for M1–M2 with named limits. MS1/chromatogram behavior, TIC and BPC from
  representative data, cancellation, locale and vendor gates remain separately open.
- [ ] Enable branch protection after the first green CI run.
